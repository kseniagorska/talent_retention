# Talent Retention Strategy

Machine learning model that predicts employee departure from the company.
Losing employees can carry a great financial cost for companies. Some studies have found that replacing a full-time employee costs a company six to nine months of salary, on average. So, this project leverages machine learning model that predicts an employee attrition.

# Dataset 
Human Resources dataset from IBM that was shared on Kaggle

# Project stracture
The steps for this project are broken out into the following sections:

Preprocess the data.

Create a neural network model to predict employee attrition.

Train and evaluate the neural network model.

# Installation guide 

``` python
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
'''
---

# Required Libraries and dependencies

``` python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from pathlib import Path
